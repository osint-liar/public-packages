It determines the validity, carrier, line type (mobile, landline, or VoIP), geographic location, and even the risk level of a phone number. This service is widely used for fraud prevention, improving communication accuracy, and ensuring compliance with regulations.\n\nIn the context of Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT), this tool is invaluable for identifying and validating phone numbers during investigations. It helps analysts uncover connections between individuals or entities, assess the legitimacy of contact information, and reduce the noise caused by false or invalid data. By providing actionable insights, it supports thorough research and enhances the credibility of findings in OSINT workflows.",
