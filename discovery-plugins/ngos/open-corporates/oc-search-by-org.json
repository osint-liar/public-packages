  "description": "OpenCorporates, accessible at https://opencorporates.com/companies, is the largest open database of companies in the world, providing detailed information on businesses across various jurisdictions. Users can search for companies by name, registration number, or jurisdiction to access data such as company status, industry classification, incorporation date, directors and officers, and registered agents. In the context of open-source intelligence (OSINT), OpenCorporates is a powerful tool for investigating the connections and relationships of business entities. Analysts can use it to trace ownership structures, identify key individuals or agents linked to multiple companies, and uncover patterns indicative of fraud, shell companies, or hidden assets. The platform's transparency and global scope make it an essential resource for due diligence, corporate research, and financial crime investigations.",
