  "description": "The Illinois Secretary of State's Business Entity Search tool, accessible at https://apps.ilsos.gov/businessentitysearch/, provides a public database to search for detailed information on businesses registered in Illinois. Users can search by business name, file number, or registered agent's name to access details such as the entity's type, status (active or dissolved), filing date, registered agent, and the agent's contact information. This tool is valuable in open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigations for verifying business legitimacy, identifying agents linked to multiple entities, and uncovering connections between businesses and individuals. Analysts often use it to trace ownership structures, detect potential shell companies, or understand business networks in fraud and compliance investigations. The searchable database is a key resource for transparency and due diligence in the state of Illinois.",
