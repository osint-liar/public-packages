  "description": "The Ohio Secretary of State's Business Search tool, accessible at https://businesssearch.ohiosos.gov/, is a comprehensive database for retrieving information about businesses registered in the state of Ohio. It provides details such as business names, entity types (e.g., LLC, corporation), registration statuses, formation dates, filing histories, and associated statutory agents. In the context of open-source intelligence (OSINT), this tool is invaluable for investigating businesses for legitimacy, mapping corporate networks, identifying ownership structures, and detecting shell companies or suspicious entities. Researchers, journalists, and investigators can use it to track relationships between businesses, assess their regulatory compliance, or uncover connections to other entities or individuals. The platform's publicly available data enables transparency and accountability, making it a critical resource for due diligence and investigative efforts.",
